This App is a Single screen app for Data visualization in charts

react-native-chart-ki is used to display the data in charts 
charts used are BAR and LINE

other libraries like 
Axios is used for fetching the Mock API
react-reduc, redux are used for configuring and using redux at application level to manage state

I have tried to keep the App simple and not much of complex so that user will be comfortable.
